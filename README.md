acmeapi
=======

WORK IN PROGRESS.

This is an ACME protocol client library written in Go.

It targets the final version of the ACME specification.

It deprecates [hlandau/acme/acmeapi](https://github.com/hlandau/acme), which
implemented the `-02` version of the specification initially implemented by
Let's Encrypt.
